2020:[Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)

Volcanic Panic is a game I made for class using java. Altough java's resources for game development are limited, I learned how Jframes can be used for gameplay and player physics.

2021: [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal.git) 

Astro Portal is a platformer on the iOS app store. It is avaiable for iPhone, iPad, and has keyboard control support for macs with Apple Silicon chips. Astro Portal was my introduction to SpriteKit. In addition to SprietKit and GameplayKit, I learned how to compliment my code with Xcode's sks files. Another challenge with making Astro Portal was managing all of the assets required to make the game work. A friend of mine digitally composed Astro Portal's music, and we made most of the art through Sketch. We also released two additional updates after the initial release on the App Store where we fixed bugs, reworked movement mechinacs to be more user-friendly, and added a personal best system. 

2022: [Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight.git)

Knight is a metrovania game in progress. Using the same SpriteKit techonology from Astro Portal, we are trying to create an open-world type game. The end result will be a game similar to Hollow Knight. I am also excited to design autonomus bots that work as bosses and NPCs. I am looking to stay highly organized with the code and avoid redundancy. Again, one of the biggest challeneges will be creating art and other assets especially since Knight is a game that is focused on combat animation.
