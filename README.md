## Sai Guntabonu's School Projects

### 2022: [Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight.git)

<img width="316" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 9 46 58 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59212272/162110241-4dc1b305-1370-468b-8cf7-4ba7a46f5e87.png">

Knight is a metroidvania game on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/spelunk-knight/id1612481607). Using the same SpriteKit framework from Astro Portal, we are trying to create an open-world game. The most challenging part of creating the game was coding the autonomus bots that work as bosses, NPCs, and enemies. We also created multiple abilities including a punch, sword, and projectile. I tried to stay highly organized with the code by avoiding redundancy. Again, one of the biggest challeneges was creating art and other assets especially since Knight is a game that is reliant on combat animation. We also stayed highly organized throughout the project by assigning roles (code, map design, asset design) to eachother and using a kanban board.

This is a promotional image that we made for Knight; it will soon be a sticker. This is one of the first times I got involved in marketing and design instead of just coding, and I enjoyed creating this art. 
### 2021: [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal.git) 

<img width="316" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 9 41 29 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59212272/162109635-6f534f59-cd96-42fc-83a7-aaa0e5e636f7.png">

Astro Portal is a platformer on the Apple [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sr/app/astro-portal/id1558706324). It is avaiable for iPhone, iPad, and has keyboard control support for macs with Apple Silicon chips. Astro Portal was my introduction to SpriteKit. In addition to SprietKit and GameplayKit, I learned how to compliment my code with Xcode's sks files. Another challenge with making Astro Portal was managing all of the assets required to make the game work. Astro Portal's music was digitally composed, and we made most of the art through Sketch. We also released two additional updates after the initial release on the App Store where we fixed bugs, reworked movement mechinacs to be more user-friendly, and added a personal best system. 

### 2020: [Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)

<img width="316" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-06 at 9 44 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59212272/162110007-26c3e749-4fcf-4b04-8912-d75c822d19dc.png">


Volcanic Panic is a game I made for class using java. Java's resources for game development are limited, but I learned how Jframes can be used for gameplay and player physics.

### 2019: MIT App Inventor Apps

This was my introduction to app development, and I created two different calculator apps as final projects. The first is a general calculator, and the second is a more advanced calculator that solves (most) derivatives, finds discriminants, and solves quadratics.
