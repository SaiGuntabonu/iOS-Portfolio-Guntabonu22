2022: [Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight.git)

Knight is a metrovania game in progress. Using the same SpriteKit framework from Astro Portal, we are trying to create an open-world game. The end result will be a game similar to Hollow Knight. I am also excited to design autonomus bots that work as bosses and NPCs. I am looking to stay highly organized with the code and avoid redundancy. Again, one of the biggest challeneges will be creating art and other assets especially since Knight is a game that is reliant on combat animation. 

2021: [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal.git) 

Astro Portal is a platformer on the Apple [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sr/app/astro-portal/id1558706324). It is avaiable for iPhone, iPad, and has keyboard control support for macs with Apple Silicon chips. Astro Portal was my introduction to SpriteKit. In addition to SprietKit and GameplayKit, I learned how to compliment my code with Xcode's sks files. Another challenge with making Astro Portal was managing all of the assets required to make the game work. Astro Portal's music was digitally composed, and we made most of the art through Sketch. We also released two additional updates after the initial release on the App Store where we fixed bugs, reworked movement mechinacs to be more user-friendly, and added a personal best system. 

2020: [Volcanic Panic](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-idk-name)

Volcanic Panic is a game I made for class using java. Java's resources for game development are limited, but I learned how Jframes can be used for gameplay and player physics.

2019: MIT App Inventor Apps

This was my introduction to app development, and I created two different calculator apps as final projects. The first is a general calculator, and the second is a more advanced calculator that solves (most) derivatives, finds discriminants, and solves quadratics.
